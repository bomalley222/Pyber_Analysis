# **Pyber Analysis**

## *Overview of Analysis*
### This assignment consists of three deliverables. Deliverable 1: A ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type. Deliverable 2: A multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type. Deliverable 3: A written report for the PyBer analysis (README.md). 

## *Results*
### The total fare by city type was the highest in urban areas, as we would expect, with suburban showing the second highest, leaving rural with the lowest. Over the time frame analysed, we saw a spike in late febuary for each city type. When analyzing the data, whether it was total rides, drivers, or fares, we saw the highest amounts in Urban areas.
